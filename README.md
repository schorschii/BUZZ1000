# About
The Buzz1000 is an Arduino-controlled buzzer system for events, e.g. Quizzes or other games in which it is necessary to determine which person pressed the button first. After a buzzer has been pressed, the other buzzers are blocked for 3 seconds - so the winner can be clearly determined.

When you press a buzzer, the controller sends a keystroke (digits 1 to 6) to the connected computer. This allows the computer to contribute to game atmosphere, e.g. by playing sound effects.

Each buzzer is equipped with 14 LEDs, which start to play different light effects when pressed. This makes it clear which player pressed his buzzer first.

The system can also be ordered fully assembled. Please contact me if you are interested.
